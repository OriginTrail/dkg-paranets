## Context

The knowledge revolution sparked by the explosive rise of Artificial Intelligence is promising to significantly improve the way we learn and consume information. However, to fulfill that promise we have to address some of the key shortfalls of using generative AI systems on their own, such as hallucinations, bias, mishandling of intellectual property rights, and even potential AI model collapse.

**[Polkabot.AI](http://Polkabot.AI) - Decentralized AI education hub on Polkadot** is achieving that by leveraging the neuro-symbolic OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG). The solution revolutionizes how anyone can interact and learn about the Polkadot ecosystem, whether a novice getting through the first steps or a seasoned user looking for the latest updates. It achieves that by allowing a wider Polkadot ecosystem to get involved in creating a trusted knowledge base that Polkabot’s AI system uses to construct its responses. Unlike the solutions using solely generative AI, Polkabot is implementing a decentralized retrieval-augmented generation (D-RAG) approach leveraging the OriginTrail DKG. Instead of the Polkabot solely relying on AI to produce a generated response, it uses AI to construct a response based on trusted inputs from the DKG populated by the wider Polkadot community. 


## Problem

The Polkabot paranet aims to provide a trusted education hub for the Polkadot community through an easy to use AI interface based on knowledge crowdsourced by the Polkadot community.

By leveraging the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG), Polkabot ensures that responses are constructed based on trusted, decentralized knowledge contributed by the community. This approach mitigates the risks associated with using generative AI alone by providing a robust foundation of verified information.

Additionally, Polkabot is set to become the main hub for building decentralized AI applications within the Polkadot ecosystem. It provides a platform where developers and users can create, interact with, and benefit from decentralized AI solutions. This resource fosters innovation and collaboration, making it easier to develop AI applications that are secure, transparent, and community-driven.

## Paranet services


### Polkabot.AI 

**Service description:** The PolkaBot.AI - Decentralized AI education hub on Polkadot is a novel approach towards automating education based on verifiable knowledge maintained for the community by the community. Polkabot is an AI-powered solution developed on the very technological fundamentals that are supposed to be instilled throughout the learning process.

**Objective:** It will be used within the Polkadot ecosystem, or leveraged for outward communication - allowing anyone to tap into the trusted knowledge and produce relevant responses as they’re interacting online (e.g. X platform).

**Service type:** off-chain

**Service endpoint URL:** [https://polkabot.ai/](https://polkabot.ai/)

**Service specification URL:** [Polkabot.ai](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hKX0hT1xm5jRrfOEnixYjY7zsVDEzpTD8BiHvpcxYQI/edit#heading=h.47kmd9au2r5q)

**Service launch date:** March 2024.


## NEURO Incentives

### Overview

The NEURO Incentives program is designed to reward contributors within the Polkadot ecosystem. A total of 312 500 NEURO incentives are requested for this IPO. 

A significant portion - 80% (250,000 NEURO) of the incentives are allocated to knowledge miners contributing knowledge assets for the paranet. Additionally, 10% of the incentives are set aside for voters to encourage active participation in governance, and 10% are allocated to the paranet operator (Trace Labs). 

Additionally, on top of NEURO rewards, a total of 3000 DOT will be distributed to the best contributors according to their contributions by Trace Labs.

We expect the process to be iterative, with potential future NEURO emission requests after this initial IPO.
